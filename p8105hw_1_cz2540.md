## Problem 1

``` r
##creating dataframe and taking mean of each variable in the dataframe#

hw_df = tibble(
norm_samp = rnorm(8),
norm_samp_logic = norm_samp >0,
vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d","e","f","g", "h"),
vec_factor = factor(c("blue", "blue","blue", "yellow", "yellow", "red","red", "red"))
)

mean(pull(hw_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.2494299

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic))
```

    ## [1] 0.75

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

  - Could not take the mean for vec\_char and vec\_factor, only for
    norm\_samp and norm\_samp\_logic. Showing up as “NA”

### Problem 1: Applying as.numeric

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic))
```

    ## [1] 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## [1] 1 1 1 3 3 2 2 2

  - Logical and factor variables were converted into numeric
    successfully. Character cannot be converted into numeric, therefore
    unable to take the mean. Logical variable converted (true" to 1,
    “false” to 0). different factor levels were converted to numbers
    and the mean was able to be taken (blue became 1, yellow became 3,
    red became
2).

### Problem 1: converting logical vector

``` r
##converting the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result, converting the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random sample by the result, and convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result ##

as.numeric(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic))*(pull(hw_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.00000000 0.62174614 0.04424225 0.22517992 1.50515821 1.92385623
    ## [7] 0.00000000 0.98127625

``` r
as.factor(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic))*(pull(hw_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic)),
    ## (pull(hw_df, : '*' not meaningful for factors

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic)))*(pull(hw_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.58126989  1.24349227  0.08848449  0.45035984  3.01031641  3.84771246
    ## [7] -2.72474957  1.96255250

### Problem 2

``` r
##creating a second data frame named (df2)# 

set.seed(1234)

plot_df2 = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  vec_logic2 = x + y > 1,
  vec_numeric2 = as.numeric(vec_logic2),
  vec_factor2 = as.factor(vec_logic2)
)
```

  - The size of the dataset is 500 rows and 5 columns.
  - The mean of the sample is 0.0018388, the median of the sample is
    -0.0207073, the standard deviation is 1.0348139
  - The proportion of cases for which x + y \> 1 is
0.232

## Problem 2: Scatterplots

``` r
##create a scatterplot of y vs. x, color points using logic, numeric, and factor variables#

ggplot(plot_df2, aes(y = y, x = x, color = vec_logic2)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105hw_1_cz2540_files/figure-gfm/problem2%20scatterplot-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("plot_df2.png")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

``` r
ggplot(plot_df2, aes(y = y, x = x, color = vec_numeric2)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105hw_1_cz2540_files/figure-gfm/problem2%20scatterplot-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggplot(plot_df2, aes(y = y, x = x, color = vec_factor2)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105hw_1_cz2540_files/figure-gfm/problem2%20scatterplot-3.png)<!-- -->

  - The logic and factor scatterplots consist of two colors that
    represent the binary values of true, in blue, and false, in red. The
    factor scatterplot has the same color scales as the logic plot
    because the factor vector was created by coercing the logic vector.
    The numeric scatterplot has a different color scale, coloring a
    numeric variable representing the values 0 or 1. This explains why
    there are only two colors plotted on the numeric scatterplot,
    despite the key showing a gradient of colors.
