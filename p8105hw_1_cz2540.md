## Problem 1

``` r
##creating dataframe and taking mean of each variable in the dataframe#

hw_df = tibble(
norm_samp = rnorm(8),
norm_samp_logic = norm_samp >0,
vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d","e","f","g", "h"),
vec_factor = factor(c("blue", "blue","blue", "yellow", "yellow", "red","red", "red"))
)

mean(pull(hw_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.4725991

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic))
```

    ## [1] 0.125

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

  - Could not take the mean for vec\_char and vec\_factor, only for
    norm\_samp and norm\_samp\_logic. Showing up as “NA”

### Problem 1: Applying as.numeric

``` r
eval = FALSE

as.numeric(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic))
```

    ## [1] 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## [1] 1 1 1 3 3 2 2 2

  - Logical and factor variables were converted into numeric
    successfully. Character cannot be converted into numeric, therefore
    unable to take the mean. Logical variable converted (true" to 1,
    “false” to 0). different factor levels were converted to numbers
    and the mean was able to be taken (blue became 1, yellow became 3,
    red became 2).

### Problem 1: converting logical vector

``` r
eval = TRUE
##converting the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result, converting the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random sample by the result, and convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result ##

as.numeric(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic))*(pull(hw_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.5110936 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000
    ## [8] 0.0000000

``` r
as.factor(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic))*(pull(hw_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic)),
    ## (pull(hw_df, : '*' not meaningful for factors

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic)))*(pull(hw_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.09914613 -0.89207085  1.02218716 -0.92498883 -0.37097936 -0.32929847
    ## [7] -0.49026931 -1.18513324

## Problem 2

``` r
##creating a second data frame named (df2)# 

set.seed(1234)

plot_df2 = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  vec_logic2 = x + y > 1,
  vec_numeric2 = as.numeric(vec_logic2),
  vec_factor2 = as.factor(vec_logic2)
)
```

  - The size of the dataset is 500 rows and 5 columns.
  - The mean of the sample is 0.0018388, the median of the sample is
    -0.0207073, the standard deviation is 1.0348139
  - The proportion of cases for which x + y \> 1 is
0.232

### Problem 2: Scatterplots

``` r
##create a scatterplot of y vs. x, color points using logic, numeric, and factor variables#

ggplot(plot_df2, aes(y = y, x = x, color = vec_logic2)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105hw_1_cz2540_files/figure-gfm/problem2%20scatterplot-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggplot(plot_df2, aes(y = y, x = x, color = vec_numeric2)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105hw_1_cz2540_files/figure-gfm/problem2%20scatterplot-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggplot(plot_df2, aes(y = y, x = x, color = vec_factor2)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105hw_1_cz2540_files/figure-gfm/problem2%20scatterplot-3.png)<!-- -->

  - The logic and factor scatterplots consist of two colors that
    represent the binary values of true, in blue, and false, in red. The
    numeric scatterplot is different in that the color scale is a
    gradient ranging from a darker to lighter blue. This represents the
    continuous scalae from 0.00 to 1.00 as seen in the output’s legend.
