```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

**Problem 1**

Dataframe comprised of:

+ a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
+ a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
+ a character vector of length 8
+ a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r part 1} 
la_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),
  norm_samp_logic = norm_samp > 8,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d","e","f","g", "h"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("blue", "blue","blue", "yellow", "yellow", "red","red", "red"))
)
mean (pull(la_df, norm_samp))
```

```{r}
