```{r problem1 chunk1} 
library (tidyverse)

hw_df = tibble(
norm_samp = rnorm(8),
norm_samp_logic = norm_samp >0,
vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d","e","f","g", "h"),
vec_factor = factor(c("blue", "blue","blue", "yellow", "yellow", "red","red", "red"))
)

##Taking mean of each variable in dataframe#
mean(pull(hw_df, norm_samp))
mean(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic))
mean(pull(hw_df, vec_char))
mean(pull(hw_df, vec_factor))

##Could not take the mean for vec_char and vec_factor, only for norm_samp and norm_samp_logic#
```

```{r problem1 chunk2}
eval = FALSE

as.numeric(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic))
as.numeric(pull(hw_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(hw_df, vec_factor))

##Logical and factor variables were converted into numeric successfully. Character cannot be converted into numeric, therefore unable to take the mean. Logical variable converted (true" to 1, "false" to 0) Different factor levels were converted to numbers and the mean was able to be taken (blue became 1, yellow became 3, red became 2)
```

```{r problem1 chunk3}
eval = TRUE

as.numeric(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic))*(pull(hw_df, norm_samp))
as.factor(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic))*(pull(hw_df, norm_samp))
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(hw_df, norm_samp_logic)))*(pull(hw_df, norm_samp))
```
